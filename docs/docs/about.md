# ✌️ About

**⚙️ A dependency injection toolkit based on Go 1.18+ Generics.**

This library implements the Dependency Injection design pattern. It may replace the `uber/dig` fantastic package. `samber/do` uses Go 1.18+ generics instead of reflection and therefore offers a typesafe API.

- [samber/mo](https://github.com/samber/mo): Monads based on Go 1.18+ Generics (Option, Result, Either...)

**Why this name?**

I love the **short name** for such a utility library. This name is the sum of `DI` and `Go` and no Go package uses this name.
